			<h2>The Minimalist Beginner's Guide to Dota</h2>
			<p>Dota 2 is a great game.</p>
			<p>Problem is, there are tons of mechanics that have made their way into the game, intentionally or not, and so many of them are just unnecessary if you're starting out. It's really uncomfortable trying to learn about an advanced when you don't even grasp the basics yet!</p>
			<p>This guide will hopefully give you the bare minimum, intuitive mechanics to help you start out in the right direction.</p>
			<h3>Background</h3>
			<p>Dota is a 5v5 game. You'll either start in the bottom left (Radiant) or top right (Dire) of the map. The place where you spawn and respawn (the fountain) will restore your Health and Mana if they aren't full, so you'll want to return there when you're low to avoid being killed.</p>
			<p>[radiant fountain image] [dire fountain image]</p>
			<p>Near that is the ancient. Once enough towers have been destroyed, the opponent can start attacking it--if it dies, you lose.</p>
			<p>

				//canvas context

			<p>Try finding those places on the minimap by clicking them, or click <a id="reveal">here</a> to reveal.</p>

				</script>

			</p>
			<p>Lastly, don't be discouraged if you face an opponent who wrecks your team. Some experienced players make new accounts to play with their newer friends or get a new rating. The system generally does a good job of getting them out of the beginner pool quickly.</p>
			<h3>Basics</h3>
			<p>When you spawn, buy some items. If you open the shop, there are suggested items. Just follow those for a while. You can also use community hero guides for more hero-specific tips.</p>
			<p>[pictures of suggested items and where to find community guides]</p>
			<p>The three important ones are Tangoes, Healing Salve, and Clarity. </p>

				<script>

					var canvas3 = document.getElementById("tango")
					var context3 = canvas3.getContext("2d");
					var tangoImg = new Image();

					tangoImg.onload = function()
					{
						context3.drawImage(tangoImg, 0, 0, 43, 32);
					};
					tangoImg.src = "/images/dota/items/tango.png";

				Target a tree to eat it. Doing so gives you some extra health regeneration, and more importantly, you don't lose the regen if you take damage.

			<p>[picture of Salve] Target yourself. Doing so gives you a lot of health regen, but if you take damage, you lose the regen.</p>

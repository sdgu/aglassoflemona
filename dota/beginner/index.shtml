			<h2>The Minimalist Beginner's Guide to Dota</h2>
			<p>Dota 2 is a great game.</p>
			<p>Problem is, there are tons of mechanics that have made their way into the game, intentionally or not, and so many of them are just unnecessary if you're starting out. It's really uncomfortable trying to learn about an advanced when you don't even grasp the basics yet!</p>
			<p>This guide will hopefully give you the bare minimum, intuitive mechanics to help you start out in the right direction.</p>
			<h3>Background</h3>
			<p>Dota is a 5v5 game. You'll either start in the bottom left (Radiant) or top right (Dire) of the map. The place where you spawn and respawn (the fountain) will restore your Health and Mana if they aren't full, so you'll want to return there when you're low to avoid being killed.</p>
			<p>[radiant fountain image] [dire fountain image]</p>
			<p>Near that is the ancient. Once enough towers have been destroyed, the opponent can start attacking it--if it dies, you lose.</p>

			<p>(The water drop-shaped thing is where you are).</p>
			<p>Lastly, don't be discouraged if you face an opponent who wrecks your team. Some experienced players make new accounts to play with their newer friends or get a new rating. The system generally does a good job of getting them out of the beginner pool quickly.</p>
			<h3>Basics</h3>
			<p>When you spawn, buy some items. If you open the shop, there are suggested items. Just follow those for a while. You can also use community hero guides for more hero-specific tips.</p>
			<p>[pictures of suggested items and where to find community guides]</p>
			<p>The three important ones are Tangoes, Healing Salve, and Clarity. </p>

			<p>Now, go walk to any lane. It doesn't matter which one, but generally you only want one person in the middle. They are also named intuitively: mid for the middle, bot for the lanes going toward the bottom, and top for the lanes going toward the top. Try out all three so you can familiarize yourself with the map. </p>

			<p>You'll pass some towers on the way. These automatically attack enemies if they get close, so you can stay somewhat safe. When the clock reaches 0:00, creeps will spawn near your base and walk along the lanes. Eventually, they'll meet up with the enemy creeps and start attacking each other.</p>
			<p>[clock] [creeps fighting, also exp range]</p>
			<p>When an enemy creep dies, you'll get experience if you're within range. It's pretty big, so you don't need to hug them.</p>
			<p>However, if you want gold, you need to get the last hit on the enemy. It's exactly what it sounds like: you deal the killing blow (by right clicking it). Don't be discouraged if you miss a lot. It takes a lot of practice to last hit well.</p>
			<p>For more details on last hitting and laning mechanics, click <a>here</a>.</p>
			<p>Eventually, you'll have some levels, and therefore spells. The best way to learn what they do is read the description, and then use it! </p>
			<p>There are various spells that “control” an opponent, in that they'll be slower, won't be able to move, won't be able to move or cast spells, etc. These are good at killing the opponent, especially when paired up with your lane partner. </p>
			<p>Killing the opponent is good because it makes you stronger and makes the opponent weaker. You get more gold and exp than killing creeps and the opponent loses gold! Later in the game, it takes a long time for the opponent to respawn after they die, so you can take these opportunities to kill more buildings.</p>
			<p>While laning, using your spells on an enemy that wanders too close is generally a good idea and can lead to kills, but remember if they get retreat to their tower, you'll want to back off. If the enemy tower starts attacking you, just run back until you're out of range.</p>
			<p>For more information on how towers target enemies, click <a>here</a>.</p>
			<p>If your opponents manage to get your health low, it's a good time to go back to base. It's a far walk, but luckily you can shorten one direction with a Town Portal Scroll.</p>
			<p>

					<tr>
						<td>
							<img src="/images/dota/items/tp.png" class="itemDesc" width="43" height="32">
						</td>
						<td>
							<p>Target somewhere near a tower. After channeling for x seconds, you'll appear where you targeted. You can also double click it or target the fountain to go back there. TPing is very important (click <a>here</a> for more), but until you're more familiar with the game, you can just use these for quick transportation.</p>
						</td>
					</tr>

			<p>At some point, your creeps should push up to the enemy tower. This is a good time to attack it, because taking down a tower gives everyone on your team gold (you also need to if you want to attack the enemy ancient). There are four "tiers" of towers, each stronger than the previous, with the outermost starting at tier 1. The previous one must be destroyed for you to attack the next one, in a given lane. So to attack a mid tier 2, you only need to destroy the mid tier 1, not bot or top. </p>
			<p>
				<canvas id="tiers" width="209" height="205"></canvas>
				<script>
					
					var canvas5 = document.getElementById("tiers");
					var context5 = canvas5.getContext("2d");
					var tierImg = new Image();

					tierImg.onload = function()
					{
						context5.drawImage(tierImg, 0, 0, 209, 205);
						drawStroked2(context5, "T1", 16, 4, "black", "white", 95, 128);
						drawStroked2(context5, "T2", 16, 4, "black", "white", 71, 145);
						drawStroked2(context5, "T3", 16, 4, "black", "white", 56, 161);
						drawStroked2(context5, "(2) T4s", 16, 4, "black", "white", 46, 180);
					};
					tierImg.src = "/images/dota/beginner/minimap_orig.png";

				</script>




			</p>
			<p>To attack the tier 3, you have to go up a hill. You'll notice that if you're at lower terrain, you can't see higher terrain. This gives the high ground an advantage, and yes, I will link this.</p>
			<p>[picture of T3 and rax]</p>
			<p>If you destroy a tier 3, you can attack the opponents' barracks. Destroying them actually makes your creeps in that lane stronger, with one corresponding to the ranged creeps and one to the melee creeps (note in League there is just one, and it's called an inhibitor, which is more accurate).</p>
			<p>These powered up creeps give your team a good advantage, so often times it's safer to back up after killing one or both rax.</p>
